To run these algorithms, do the following steps. The only requirement is to have pip installed either through the Anaconda Prompt or on the Command Prompt

1) Install requirements and type into command prompt: pip install -r requirements.txt
2) Run any algorithm by typing in python {filename}.py into command prompt (preferred). Alternatively, use iPython in Spyder or Jupyter Notebook

  1. Decision Tree: python decision_tree.py
  2. Boosting: python boosting.py
  3. kNN: python knn.py
  4. NeuralNetwork: python neural_network.py
  5. Support Vector Machines: python svm.py
